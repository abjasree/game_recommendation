# Game Recommendation
- In this project we have scrapped the data about the games and the hours played by each user for each game using BeautifulSoup
- We have used the hours played by the user as the implicit feedback to give top 5 recommendation
- We have used different base models as well as some complex model to give the recommendation
- We also used the dimensionality reduction techniques and visualized the data and found cluster and this information is used in building a cluster based content boosted model which gave the highest hit rate of 0.66 i.e., out of 5 games recommended 3 were played by the user
